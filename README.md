Team repo for Programming 3 at WJU

IMPORTANT:
The official version of PyOpenGL will not work with this project.
Please download the unofficial version here: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyopengl.
  (Not the accelerate one, the regular one, e.g. PyOpenGL‑3.1.5‑cp39‑cp39‑win_amd64.whl)
If downloading that isn't possible, simply remove everything related to GLUT. The crash should go.
